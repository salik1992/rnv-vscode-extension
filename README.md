# ReNative VSCode Extension
This extension tries to make your life easier to work with ReNative on a daily basis by providing you
some clickable tools that will ease up your command line work.

## ReNative platforms x appConfigs x buildSchemes x commands Tree View
It adds a **ReNative** section into the Explorer tab where it lists all available combinations of
your launchable configurations in an easy-to-navigate tree view.

## Commands in Command Palette 
It adds a command for each of rnv's start, run, build and deploy commands. Running these commands
from VSCode command palette will prompt you for platform, appConfig and buildScheme, and providing
you the options to choose from, of course.

## Favourite commands
Allows you to define you favourite commands to run. Head into settings to start adding your commands.

## Configurable runner
Allows you to prepend `rnv` with a runner (defaults to recommended `npx`).
